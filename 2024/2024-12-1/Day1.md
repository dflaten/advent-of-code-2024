# Day 1: Historian Hysteria
The problem here boiled down to having two lists and doing two small tasks with them.
First the lists needed to be sorted and the differences between the sorted lists needed to be added.

second and then multiplying that number by the value of the element being counted. The sum of all the
numbers was the similarity_score.
