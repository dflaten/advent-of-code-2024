# Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports
## Part 1
Given a text file with numbers seperated by spaces on each line like so:
```
1 2 3 4 5
4 3 2 1 0
```
Where each number is a 'level' and each line is a 'report'. Analyze each report
and see if the numbers in the report are either increasing or decreasing by 3 or less. Each
report tha meets these critieria is considered 'safe'.

Print the number of reports that are 'safe'.

## Part 2
Expand the function in part 1 so that if one item from each report ,which would be invalid, is removed
the report is still considered valid.
