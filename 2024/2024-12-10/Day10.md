# Hoof It

Given a topographical map that looks like:

```
89010123
78121874
87430965
96549874
45678903
32019012
01329801
10456732
```

## Part 1
For all the unique nines that can be reached from zero increasing by one at each step.

This larger example has 9 trailheads with scores: 5, 6, 5, 3, 1, 3, 5, 3, 5. Adding them together gives 36.

## Part 2
Find all of the routes which start at 0 and end at 9, increasing by 1 at each step.
The routes can only move up, down, left, or right, and cannot move diagonally. Each
route has a score which is the number of trails (paths to 9) that can be made from the route.
