# Day 8: Resonant Collinearity

Given an input that looks like:

```
............
........0...
.....0......
.......0....
....0.......
......A.....
............
............
........A...
.........A..
............
............
```

Where each character represents a point in a 2D grid and each unique character represents a type of signal. Determine
how many ani-nodes are present in the grid. An anti-node is placed at any point that is perfectly in line with two antennas
of the same frequency but only when one of the antennas is twice as far away as the other.

So for any pair of antennas with the same frequency, there are two antinodes, one on either side.

So if you have two `a` antennas here are where the antinodes, marked with a `#`, would be:

```
..........
...#......
..........
....a.....
..........
.....a....
..........
......#...
..........
..........
```

Anti-nodes that are placed "off the grid" are not counted.

Example, this one should have two more anti-nodes but they are off-grid:
```
..........
...#......
#.........
....a.....
........a.
.....a....
..#.......
......#...
..........
..........
```
## Problem 1
Given an input how many unique locations within the bounds of the map contain an anti-node?
