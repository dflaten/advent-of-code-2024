# Day 3: Mull It Over
Take the input and find all 'multiply' statements where they match the pattern:
`mul(x,y)` where x and y are integers up to 3 digits long.

Sum all of the results of the multiplication and return the result.

# Part 2
Remove all the substrings from the original that are book ended by `don't()` and 'do()`.

Then calculate the results on the new result.
