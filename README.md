# Advent of Code

This repo holds solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges I've worked through
by year.

## 2024
First year I attempted to solve the challenges. My goal was to spend an hour or two each day and see how
many problems I could get through in Python. During the month I learned of a few new Python libraries and
how to work better with a few I was already familiar with.
